# Principal-Component-Analysis-with-NumPy

In this project, I have performed all the machine learning without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels. The aim of this project and is to implement all the machinery of the various learning algorithms myself, so I have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals. What I have learn is to able to implement and apply PCA from scratch using NumPy in Python, conduct basic exploratory data analysis, and create simple data visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
